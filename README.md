## Gamedev.tv Udemy Course - Unity 2D game development
### Snow Boarder
Snowboarding game where the player needs to reach the end of the track while doing tricks. 
Some of the key lessons include: 
* Using sprite shapes for the level layout
* Using edge colliders
* Implementing effectors to push the player
* Creating particle effects with triggers
* Playing around with the physics system

### Tile Vania
2D side-scrolling platformer. The player must jump and climb to avoid obstacles and enemies (or shoot them!) in order to reach the end of the level, with multiple levels to be played.
Some of the key lessons include:
* Using a level loading system so that the when we finish a particular level, the following one is loaded, and so on
* Using the tilemap system in Unity to create the levels
* Handling animations, transitions, for the player and enemies
* Persisting game sessions
* Using State-Driven cameras.

### Laser Defender
Laser defender is a top-down, arcade style, space shooter. The core premise of the game is to avoid waves of enemies for as long as possible by dodging bullets and collisions, and shooting enemies to earn points. 
Some of the key lessons learned include:
* Instantiating objects at runtime
* Using pathfinding so enemies follow a set path
* Adding music and sound effects
* Using particle systems and camera effects
* This is also the first time we're adding a menu scene and game over one as well, instead of starting the game right down the bat. In the menu, the player can either start the game or quit, and once the player dies their score is shown and can opt to play again.
* Finally, once we had our core working game finished, we worked with building the game for different platforms, and also sharing our game through the internet.

## Gamedev.tv Udemy Course - Unity Mobile game development
### Race Driver
Race Drive is a simple mobile driving game where you have to clear a course without crashing with any obstacles. Your aim is to survive as long as possible to get more and more points, as the game gets progressively more difficult with an increased speed. Being one of my first mobile games experiences, there's quite a lot I had the opportunity to learn. Some of the key lessons where:
* Working with touch input for mobile phones
* Building my game to Android and iOS devices
* Creating an energy system which takes some (real) time to replenish
* Creating notifications for Android and iOS devices when certain events occur (like energy being full again)

## Game Jams
### Brackeys Game Jam February 2024
This was my first ever game jam! I decided it was finally time for me to participate in one, since they are a great opportunity for training your creative output and meeting new people. The theme for this jam was “What’s behind the door?”. My idea was to create a simple, comical, think-out-the-box puzzle game. I designed most of the art, minus the props that I used, and the music and sound effects were all taken from the internet (with the right licenses of course). 

Since I was still new to game development, I made sure to keep it simple and not bite more than I could chew. Most of my first ideas were fun, but unfeasible for someone like me at the time. This is an important lesson for me.

Overall, I’m proud of what I created. This was my first experience designing something entirely of my own, without any course to follow or outside input. I made some mistakes, of course, but they are great lessons for myself since I own this creation, instead of just being a template one follows.  I learned a lot about game design, art, music, etc, in these few weeks. From providing hints to players to making sure the art design is coherent… There are things I overlooked, others I have to work on, and some that I did right.  And it made me realize the importance of feedback! Learning from this experience was all possible thanks to other creators. Sometimes it’s hard to critique your own creations, so it’s great to have some help from others.
